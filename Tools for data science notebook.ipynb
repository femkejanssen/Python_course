First I was kinda afraid of data analysis and programming, but the more I dived into this, the more I started to like it and see the opportunities it brings. I have always liked math at high school and puzzling with numbers as well. I found out that I also really like coding and working in R and Rstudio. Hence, I would like to learn more programming languages. I think it is a wonderful field of expertise with lots and lots of possibilities and I would love to learn more about this.* "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### My code below is shows Pythagoras "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "x = 4\ny = 6\nc = (y*y) + (x*x)\nprint(c)", "execution_count": 7, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "text": "52\n", "name": "stdout"}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Horizontal rules:\n\n---\n\n***\n\n___\n\n\nThis | is | a  | table\n--- | --- | --- | --- \nx | x | x | x\nx | x | x | x \n\n\nAnd this is a bulleted list:\n\n* x\n* x\n* x\n* x\n* x"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
