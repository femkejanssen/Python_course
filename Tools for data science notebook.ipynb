    "*I am interested in data science, since this recently crossed my path in my studies. First I was kinda afraid of data analysis and programming, but the more I dived into this, the more I started to like it and see the opportunities it brings. I have always liked math at high school and puzzling with numbers as well. I found out that I also really like coding and working in R and Rstudio. Hence, I would like to learn more programming languages. I think it is a wonderful field of expertise with lots and lots of possibilities and I would love to learn more about this.* "
